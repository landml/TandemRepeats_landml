parameters :
    assembly_input_ref :
        ui-name : |
            Assembly
        short-hint : |
            The assembly to analyze

    match_weight :
        ui-name : |
            Match Weight
        short-hint : |
            SW weight for matches
        long-hint : |
            These parameters are for Smith-Waterman style local alignment using wraparound dynamic programming.
            Lower weights allow alignments with more mismatches and indels. A match weight of 2 has proven effective
            with mismatch and indel penalties in the range of 3 to 7. Mismatch and indel weights are interpreted as
            negative numbers. A 3 is more permissive and a 7 less permissive. The recomended values for Match Mismatch
            and Delta are 2, 7, and 7 respectively.

    prob_pm:
        ui-name : |
            PM value
        short-hint : |
            PM value for Probabilistic data
        long-hint : |
            Probabilistic data is available for PM values of 80 and 75 and PI values of 10 and 20.
            The best performance can be achieved with values of PM=80 and PI=10. Values of PM=75 and PI=20 give
            results which are very similar, but often require as much as ten times the processing time when compared
            with values of PM=80 and PI=10.

    prob_pi:

    min_score:
        ui-name : |
            Minimum Score
        short-hint : |
            Smallest score included
        long-hint : |
            The alignment of a tandem repeat must meet or exceed this alignment score to be reported. For example,
            if we set the matching weight to 2 and the minimun score to 50, assuming perfect alignment, we will need
            to align at least 25 characters to meet the minimum score (for example 5 copies with a period of size 5).
        placeholder : |
            50

    max_period_size :
        ui-name : |
            Maximum period size
        short-hint : |
            Largest period size considered
        long-hint : |
            Period size is the program's best guess at the pattern size of the tandem repeat.
            The program will find all repeats with period size between 1 and 2000,
            but the output can be limited to a smaller range.

description : |
    <p>A tandem repeat in DNA is two or more adjacent, approximate copies of a
    pattern of nucleotides. Tandem Repeats Finder is a program to locate and
    display tandem repeats in DNA sequences. In order to use the program,
    the user submits a sequence in <a
    href="trf.definitions.html#fasta">FASTA</a> format. There is no need to
    specify the pattern, the size of the pattern or any other parameter. The output consists of two files:
    a repeat table file and an
    alignment file. The repeat table contains
    information about each repeat, including its location, size, number of
    copies and nucleotide content. Clicking on the location indices for one
    of the table entries opens a second web browser that shows an alignment
    of the copies against a consensus pattern. The program is very fast,
    analyzing sequences on the order of .5Mb in just a few seconds.
    Submitted sequences may be of arbitrary length. Repeats with pattern
    size in the range from 1 to 2000 bases are detected. Sequence information
    sent to the server is confidential and deleted after program execution.
