            Period size is the program's best guess at the pattern size of the tandem repeat. The program will find all repeats with period size between 1 and 2000, but the output can be limited to a smaller range.

description : |
    <p>A tandem repeat in DNA is two or more adjacent, approximate copies of a
    pattern of nucleotides. Tandem Repeats Finder is a program to locate and
    display tandem repeats in DNA sequences. In order to use the program,
    the user submits a sequence in <a
    href="trf.definitions.html#fasta">FASTA</a> format. There is no need to
    specify the pattern, the size of the pattern or any other parameter. The output consists of two files:
    a repeat table file and an
    alignment file. The repeat table contains
    information about each repeat, including its location, size, number of
    copies and nucleotide content. Clicking on the location indices for one
    of the table entries opens a second web browser that shows an alignment
    of the copies against a consensus pattern. The program is very fast,
    analyzing sequences on the order of .5Mb in just a few seconds.
    Submitted sequences may be of arbitrary length. Repeats with pattern
    size in the range from 1 to 2000 bases are detected. Sequence information
    sent to the server is confidential and deleted after program execution.
